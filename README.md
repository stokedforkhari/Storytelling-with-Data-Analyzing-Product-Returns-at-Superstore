# Storytelling-with-Data-Analyzing-Product-Returns-at-Superstore
🎯 Objective
To investigate patterns behind returned orders and build a compelling narrative that enables the CEO to understand return behavior and make informed decisions to reduce return volume.

📊 Part 1: Identifying the Causes of Returns

I performed a detailed data analysis by joining the Returns and Orders tables and creating a calculated field to quantify the return rate. Key visual analyses included:

Scatterplot (Sales vs. Returns): Assessed correlation between sales volume and return frequency across product subcategories to identify outliers and high-risk items.

Return Rate by Category: Bar charts highlighted which product categories had disproportionately high return rates.

Customer Analysis: Focused on customers with multiple orders to reveal those most prone to returning products.

Geographic Distribution: Mapped return rates by state to uncover regional patterns.

Seasonal Trends: Evaluated return behavior by month to identify possible seasonal spikes.

Composite Charts: Combined product, time, and location factors to discover interactions driving returns.

📐 Part 2: Designing a Dashboard

To effectively communicate insights, I designed and developed a return-monitoring dashboard using Tableau:

Created three hand-drawn mockups to brainstorm layout ideas.

Chose a final design and built a dashboard wireframe using empty containers for structure.

Added interactive visualizations, titles, and filters based on my findings.

Ensured the final dashboard was user-friendly and optimized for executive review.

📖 Part 3: Storytelling & Presentation

I constructed a full Tableau Story to present my findings, including:

Narrative Flow: Captions and story points guided the audience through the return analysis.

Metric Evaluation: Compared return rate, total returns, and return cost to determine the most useful metric depending on context.

Root Cause Summary: Highlighted key drivers of returns with supporting visuals.

Dashboard Walkthrough: Explained how to navigate and use filters to identify actionable insights.

Recommendations: Provided data-driven strategies to reduce returns and improve customer satisfaction.

The final presentation was delivered in a concise 5-minute format, showcasing the story arc, dashboard utility, and proposed next steps for implementation.

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, visual analytics, executive storytelling, and dashboard design—all tailored toward solving real-world business problems.
